``japaneezu`` is a language study tool with a curses interface that allows the user to "drill down" from the document
to the phoneme level.

Any document or set of documents can be used as a study tool. Automatic, integrated pronunciation, dictionary, language
parsing, conjugation, etc. are supported.

Plans for integration with `Anki <http://ankisrs.net/>`_ and other tools are in the works.

Multi-language support is planned, but currently Japanese is the only supported target language.
