Please feel free to jump in and collaborate if you think this looks interesting.

The goal is for this to be a language-learning "suite" (which will probably be Japanese-centric in the near term.)

Features:
 * Language "token" containment at the python level: document->paragraph->sentence->word->character.
 * Some nice UI(s)
 * Lots of useful information available per-context: translation, reading, flashcard data, online translation engines, ocr, etc, etc.
 * Ability to toggle "reading" (furigana, etc.)
 * Ability to toggle to-from ideograph/fully-phonetic
 * Lots of useful database stuff: "word"/character appearance frequency with reference to some example text.
 * YOUR performance data (flashcards, etc.)
 * Ability to deal with numerous import formats.
